# Business

- Homework 5 not yet graded, *sorry*

- Homework 6 **due Monday April 9**

- Homework 7 will be posted next week

---

# Review

- So far we have learned that our syntactic competence includes

  - parts of speech
  - PSRs for combining them to create  
  - sentences with hierarchical structure

--

### Today,

- We will add to this list information about what types of words can be combined.

- And we will learn how to discover PSRs from foreign language data.

---

# Final English PSRs

CP $\rightarrow$ (C) TP <br>
TP $\rightarrow$ {NP/CP} (T) VP <br>
NP $\rightarrow$ (D) (AdjP+) N (PP+) (CP) <br>
VP $\rightarrow$ (AdvP+) V (NP) ({NP/CP}) (AdvP+) (PP+) (AdvP+) <br>
PP $\rightarrow$ P NP <br>
AdjP $\rightarrow$ (AdvP) Adj <br>
AdvP $\rightarrow$ (AdvP) Adv 

In groups, take 10 minutes to draw the trees for the two sentences you are given. I will then select which groups will draw one tree on the board.

# Subcategorization

-Our PSRs overgenerate

.pull-left[
- John told Jim that Eliza is leaving. <br>
- Fenster put the wombat in the bathtub. <br>
- The linguist on the table
]

.pull-right[
- *John kicked Jim that Eliza is leaving
- *Fenster put the wombat
- *The linguist on French
]

--

- The standard story for this is **subcategorization**: lexical entries of words include further restrictions about what their phrases contain (animate NPs, CPs, no CPs, etc.)

---

# Phrase structure in other languages

- Last week, we talked about how languages vary in basic word order

--

- In our more sophisticated understanding of syntax, this translates to variation in phrase structure rules.
- What rule can we posit for VPs in Japanese? <br>

Satoshi-ga |Takashi-wo  |disu-tta
-----------|------------|---------
Satoshi-NOM|Takashi-ACC |diss-PAST
.center["Satoshi dissed Takashi"]

--

- VP $\rightarrow$ (NP) V

---

# A digression on case

- NOM (*nominative*) and ACC (*accusative*) are explicit expressions of **case** <br>

Satoshi-ga |Takashi-wo  |disu-tta
-----------|------------|---------
Satoshi-NOM|Takashi-ACC |diss-PAST
.center["Satoshi dissed Takashi"]

--

- **Case** is a property of nouns depending on their role in a sentence <br>

He        |saw   |him       |
----------|------|----------|
nominative|past  |accusative|

--

- Strictly speaking, all nouns have case, but it is not always pronounced (depending on the morphology of the language) <br>

.center[John-Ø.NOM saw Steve-Ø.ACC]

---

# Phrase structure in other languages

- Consider the following data and questions on Sinhala <br>

Jōn | ballavə| däkka|
----|--------|------|
John|dog     |saw
.center["John saw the dog"]  

Jōn | janēle |iñdəla| ballavə|  däkka|
----|--------|------|--------|-------|
John|window  |from  |dog     |saw    |
.center["John saw the dog from the window"]

- What is the PP rule of Sinhala?

--

PP $\rightarrow$ NP P

--

- What is the VP rule of Sinhala?

--

VP $\rightarrow$ (PP) NP V

---

# Practice

In groups, posit an NP, VP, and TP rule to account for the Hixkaryana data below. 

- *some* and *all* are determiners
- assume AdjP $\rightarrow$ Adj 
- What is the part of speech of *Newehyatxhe* in (b)?<br>

Draw the trees for (a)-(c)

(a)|kuraha|yonyhoryeno|biyekomo
---|------|-----------|--------
gl:|bow   |made       |boy
.center["The boy made a bow"]

(b)|Newehyatxhe|woriskomo|komo
---|-----------|---------|----
gl:|take-bath  |women    |all
.center["All the women take a bath"]

(c)|Toto  |heno|komo|yonoye|kamara
---|------|----|----|------|------
gl:|person|dead|all |ate   |jaguar
.center["The jaguar ate all the dead people"]

---

# Recap

Today, 

- We extended our knowledge of linguistic competence to include information about how syntactic categories can determine what they combine with, called *subcategorization*.

- We saw that PSRs can vary from language to language. 

- And we practiced discovering the PSRs and drawing trees for sentences in a language other than SAE

Next week, we will learn what movement is and begin semantics.
